# Laravel PyCharm Theme

Code highlighting theme for Visual Studio Code and for PyCharm.


### 1. Theme for Visual Studio Code:

Fork of documentation inspired [Laravel theme](https://github.com/victorze/vscode-theme-laravel) patched to look more like PyCharm theme. Differences from [original Laravel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=victorzevallos.vscode-theme-laravel):

* main colors were tweaked a bit,
* functions names are bold now,
* docstrings are strings now not comments,
* comments and self are italic now,
* constans color now differs from builtins color.

Font on Visual Studio Code screenshot is [Robotization Mono](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/open-fonts#roboto-mono).
